# Yadira — Firebase Setup Guide

**Cloud sync is on by default.** The production Firebase web config
(project `yadira-1c1dd`) is committed in `src/lib/firebase.ts`, so every
build — local dev, Render, anywhere — syncs to Firestore in real time
without any env vars. (Web config is safe to commit; security lives in
the Firestore rules below.)

Setting `VITE_FIREBASE_*` env vars overrides the committed config, e.g.
to point a dev build at a separate test project. Steps 1–4 below are the
original guide for creating a project from scratch — you only need them
for a new/override project.

## Step 0 — Protect your $300 credits FIRST

Before creating anything:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console → **Billing** → **Budgets & alerts**
2. Create a budget: **$25/month** with email alerts at 50% / 90% / 100%
3. This is a prototype — if you ever see more than a few dollars of spend, something is misconfigured

Firestore free tier alone covers a prototype easily: 50K reads + 20K writes **per day**, free. You will likely spend $0.

## Step 1 — Create the Firebase project

1. [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) → **Add project**
2. Name it `yadira` (link it to your existing Google Cloud billing account)
3. Skip Google Analytics (not needed)

## Step 2 — Add a Web App

1. Project Overview → **</>** (Web) icon → register app as `yadira-web`
2. It shows you a `firebaseConfig` object — keep that tab open

## Step 3 — Enable Firestore

1. Build → **Firestore Database** → Create database
2. Choose **Start in test mode** for now (we lock it down when Auth lands)
3. Region: `us-east1` or whatever is closest

## Step 4 — Wire the config into the app

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in from the config object:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="yadira-xxxx.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="yadira-xxxx"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="yadira-xxxx.appspot.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="1234567890"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:1234567890:web:abc123"
```

Restart the dev server. Console will say:
`[Yadira] Firebase connected — cloud sync active.`

## Step 5 — Verify the magic

Open the app in **two different browsers** (or your phone + laptop). Add a memory in one — watch it appear in the other in real time. That's the caregiver-phone / patient-tablet story, live.

## What changed in the code

- `src/types.ts` — shared interfaces (extracted from App.tsx)
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` — Firebase init with graceful fallback
- `src/lib/useStore.ts` — `useStoreList` / `useStoreDoc` hooks (Firestore + localStorage mirror)
- `src/App.tsx` — four localStorage blocks replaced with hooks; **caregiver profile now persists** (it previously reset to Eleanor/Thomas on every refresh)

## Step 6 — Per-family care circles (built) + security rules (paste these!)

Every signed-in account now gets its own isolated circle: the circle id IS the
Firebase Auth uid. `default-circle` remains only as the anonymous demo space.
A patient device joins the family's circle by being signed in with the
caregiver's account (enter patient mode from the signed-in device — the uid,
and therefore the circle, carries over).

**Before taking real customers**, replace the test-mode Firestore rules
(Firestore Database → Rules) with:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Each family's circle is readable/writable ONLY by that account.
    match /careCircles/{circleId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == circleId;
    }
    // The anonymous demo circle stays open so the public demo keeps working.
    match /careCircles/default-circle/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Known limitation: local demo sessions (the no-Firebase fallback and "I'm a
Patient" without a signed-in caregiver) are not Firebase-authenticated, so
under these rules their cloud sync silently stays off and they run on
localStorage only. That's the correct trade: paying families are isolated
and authenticated; the demo still works.
